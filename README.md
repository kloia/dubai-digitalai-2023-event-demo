* device_type field must be local in the base_config file to access local device.


# Test Run

1. It can be run based on scenario or feature with the green RUN button on the IDE.

2. Run from terminal with scenario or feature tag in project directory:
   
   `cucumber --tag @login`

3. Run parallel from terminal with scenario or feature tag in project directory:
   
   `ruby cucumber_parallel_run.rb "login"`
